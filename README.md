# The 327 must know TOEFL words

  Developing solid TOEFL vocabulary skills can be one of the most challenging parts of studying for the exam, but itâ€™s also one of the most important.
  Many TOEFL questions either ask you the definition of a word outright or require you to have knowledge of certain words in order to answer a question correctly. With so many words in the English language, which are the ones you need to know?

I took a a table of TOEFL vocabulary list online, tried to clean the data and convert it from a .txt file to a .csv file using what I just learned recently. Than, I used the Tkinter Python library to design an easy, responsive GUI that allows the user to show a random word from the list and its explanation after 4 seconds. Finally, the user can either click on the check button which means that the user already knows the word so it gets removed from the full list (it won't show up even if the user restarts the GUI) or click on the cross button to skip to the next word (the user doesn't know the word)
